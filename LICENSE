The program code in the 'bit-twiddle' repository (currently available at https://github.com/alexdowad/bit-twiddle) has been placed in the public domain by its author. You can do anything you want with it, anything at all. You can copy it, sell it, buy it, lease it, rent it out, put it in pawn, or use it as a down payment on a new truck. You can sing it out in the shower, or on a crowded bus. You can even inscribe it on a silk flag, and plant it on Kilimanjaro's snow-covered slopes. The possibilities are endless!

If 'public domain' isn't what you like, then you can use this code under a CC0 (creative commons) license. Still no good? Drop the author a note and we'll see how to fix you up.
