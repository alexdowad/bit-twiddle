The program code in the 'bit-twiddle' repository (currently available at https://github.com/alexdowad/bit-twiddle) has been placed in the public domain by its author. You can do anything you want with it, anything at all. You can copy it, sell it, buy it, lease it, rent it out, put it in pawn, or use it as a down payment on a new truck. You can sing it out in the shower, or on a crowded bus. You can even inscribe it on a silk flag, and plant it on Kilimanjaro's snow-covered slopes. The possibilities are endless!

If you need a specific license, then make a copy of the code, solemnly declare that the copy belongs to you, and license it to yourself under any terms you desire.
